# Thinking About Abstraction

In my working career as an R developer, each problem I have worked on requires abstraction, and because we are working on abstracting problems professionally, we need to learn how to think about them. This has pushed me further into thinking about my project structure *between* projects and further *between* companies because the more boilerplate I can generate that is transferable the less work I have to do.

## What are Functions?

A function allows us to define tasks to be completed succinctly - they are logical legos.

There are three functions used here, `max`, `c`, and `+`.

```{r}
max(c(1, 2, 3, 4)) + 1
```

```{r}
add <- function(x,y) {
  `+`(x, y)
}
add(max(c(1, 2, 3, 4)), 1)
```
