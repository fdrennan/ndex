# Abstraction

In my working career as an R developer, each problem I have worked on requires abstraction. For example, consider the following verbs and nouns.

| Verb | Noun    |
|------|---------|
| read | file    |
| sum  | numbers |

When we are programming, we are deciding the order of actions the computer should take. And we should think about these tasks in a logical order. For example, the actions above - how would you do that using the R language? And where would you assume to look?

This definition, or statement of fact, is also known as a function. You are intimately familiar with functions, even if you don't know them yet. By the end of this chapter, I hope to influence the way you think about solving problems in the light of functional programming.

Newton's definition can be defined in R.

```{r}
calculate_mass <- function(density, volume) {
    density * volume
}

calculate_mass(2, 2)
```
