<h1 class="text-center">Functions</h1>

_The Principia_ begins with a definition. Isaac Newton is stating mass (quantity of matter) is equal to (the measure of the same) it's density and volume (bulk) multiplied (combined).

This definition, or statement of fact, is also known as a function. You are intimately familiar with functions, even if you don't know it yet. By the end of this chapter, I hope to influence the way you think about solving problems in the light of functional programming. 

Newton's definition can be defined in R 
```{r}
calculate_mass <- function(density, volume) {
    density * volume
}

calculate_mass(2, 2)
```
