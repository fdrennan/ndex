<h1 class="text-center">Course Requirements</h1>

It's difficult determining the best place to start - and to start at the beginning 
for one person may be the wrong place to start for another. In this sense, I have 
struggled to start at a level that I would call "beginner" because it takes too long
to get to the fun stuff. 

So I'm going to start with the fun stuff, and then backtrack a bit. What this means 
is that the course requirements at the start of this project will be explained a little
more in depth in the future - but not now. 

If you are interested in following along but the following installations seem 
complicated, please feel free to reach out. We can document the process for this 
course and get you up and running quickly.
